    I don’t pray to god but I did today
    Just to take a minute of the pain away
    ‘Cause I’m scared that I believe in nothin
    Am I on my own?
    I don’t wanna break but I did today
    Guess I only have myself to blame
    Should I just let go?
    I’m afraid to let go

    I’d do anything, anything
    Just to feel something
    Just to feel something
    Yea I’d give everything, everything
    Just to feel something
    Just to feel something <br>
