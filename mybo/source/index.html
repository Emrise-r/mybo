    I don’t pray to god but I did today <br>
    Just to take a minute of the pain away <br>
    ‘Cause I’m scared that I believe in nothin <br>
    Am I on my own? <br>
    I don’t wanna break but I did today <br>
    Guess I only have myself to blame <br>
    Should I just let go? <br>
    I’m afraid to let go <br>
    <br>
    I’d do anything, anything <br>
    Just to feel something <br>
    Just to feel something <br>
    Yea I’d give everything, everything <br>
    Just to feel something <br>
    Just to feel something
